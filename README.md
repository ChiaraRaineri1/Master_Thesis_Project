# Optimizing Vessel-on-a-Chip Fabrication Methods for Improved Modeling of Vascular Diseases

Vessel-on-a-Chip (VoC) platforms provide physiologically relevant
models to study vascular biology and disease mechanisms in vitro. This thesis
focuses on optimizing the fabrication of a complex high-fidelity VoC model, im-
proving lumen uniformity, perfusability, and reproducibility. A microfluidic device
was designed to create a 3D cylindrical lumen within a collagen I hydrogel using
an acupuncture needle, 160 µm in diameter, as a sacrificial template.

Three hydrogel chamber geometries (hexagonal, rhomboidal, circular) were com-
pared. The circular chamber minimized air bubble formation and gel detachment,
leading to 71% perfusable lumens, compared to 43% of hexagonal and 33% rhom-
boidal. Polymerization conditions were optimized, improving lumen stability and
formation success rate.

A motorized extraction system was developed to replace manual needle removal.
Statistical analysis showed that automated extraction significantly reduced lumen
diameter variability (p < 0.05), while maintaining a similar mean diameter (about
170 µm). Compared to manual extraction, the automated system reduced hydrogel
detachment and improved lumen integrity.

For validation, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded into
the fabricated lumens. Cells adhered and displayed initial signs of endothelializa-
tion of the lumen, although further optimization is required to maintain endothelial
coverage over time.

These findings contribute to the standardization of VoC fabrication, enabling more
reliable in vitro microvascular models for disease research and drug testing.
